#### [v1.0.6](https://github.com/janreges/siteone-crawler/compare/v1.0.5...v1.0.6)

> 8 December 2023

- readme: removed bold links from the intro (it didn't look as good on github as it did in the IDE) [`b675873`](https://github.com/janreges/siteone-crawler/commit/b6758733cde67f11322a2f82573b19ec1a0edc9d)
- readme: improved intro and gif animation with the real output [`fd9e2d6`](https://github.com/janreges/siteone-crawler/commit/fd9e2d69c8f940cfaa81ad7bab86f1a74f01b0da)
- http auth: for security reasons, we only send auth data to the same 2nd level domain (and possibly subdomains). With HTTP basic auth, the name and password are only base64 encoded and we would send them to foreign domains (which are referred to from the crawled website) [`4bc8a7f`](https://github.com/janreges/siteone-crawler/commit/4bc8a7f9871064aa1c88c374aa299904409d2817)
- html report: increased specificity of the .header class for the header, because this class were also used by the generic class at &lt;td class='header'&gt; in security tab [`9d270e8`](https://github.com/janreges/siteone-crawler/commit/9d270e884545d6459f20348db71404e513ae8928)
- html report: improved readability of badge colors in light mode [`76c5680`](https://github.com/janreges/siteone-crawler/commit/76c5680397446b84f3b13800590d914b7a9b0533)
- crawler: moving the decrement of active workers after parsing URLs from the content, where further filling of the queue could occur (for this reason, queue processing could sometimes get stuck in the final stages) [`f8f82ab`](https://github.com/janreges/siteone-crawler/commit/f8f82ab61c1969952bb70f1b598ed3d97938a84e)
- analysis: do not parse/check empty HTML (it produced unnecessary warning) - it is valid to have content-type: text/html but with connect-lengt: 0 (for example case for 'gtm.js?id=') [`436d81b`](https://github.com/janreges/siteone-crawler/commit/436d81b81f905178fb972f8b5cd0236bac244bc4)

- options: in the case of dir/file validation, we want to work with absolute paths for more precise error messages [`6df228b`](https://github.com/janreges/siteone-crawler/commit/6df228bdfc87a2c9fb6eee611fdc87d976b7f721)
- crawler.php: improved baseDir detection - we want to work with absolute path in all scenarios [`9d1b2ce`](https://github.com/janreges/siteone-crawler/commit/9d1b2ce9bedb15ede90bcee9641e1cfc62b9c3cc)

- version: 1.0.4.20231201 + changelog [`8e15781`](https://github.com/janreges/siteone-crawler/commit/8e15781265cdd9cce10d9dcde57d46b57b50e1cf)
- options: ignore empty values in the case of directives with the possibility of repeated definition [`5e30c2f`](https://github.com/janreges/siteone-crawler/commit/5e30c2f8ad6cf00ad819ba1d7d6ec4e6c95a7113)
- http-cache: now the http cache is turned off using the 'off' value (it's more understandable) [`9508409`](https://github.com/janreges/siteone-crawler/commit/9508409fbba2d96dc92cd73bed5abe462d5cea15)
- core options: added --console-width to enforce the definition of the console width and disable automatic detection via 'tput cols' on macOS/Linux or 'mode con' on Windows (used by Electron GUI) [`8cf44b0`](https://github.com/janreges/siteone-crawler/commit/8cf44b06616e15301c486146a7c6b1003ce5137f)

- best practice analysis: in the case of checking an image (e.g. for the existence of WebP/AVIF), we also want to check external images, because very often websites have images linked from external domains or services for image modification or optimization [`6100187`](https://github.com/janreges/siteone-crawler/commit/6100187347e0bbba6270335e2d9b2faf37475333)
- html report: set scaleDown as default object-fit for image gallery [`91cd300`](https://github.com/janreges/siteone-crawler/commit/91cd300dcd7455c2b9be548fb2746cea7fd7c904)

- image gallery: list of all images on the website (except those from the srcset, where there would be duplicates only in other sizes or formats), including SVG with rich filtering options (through image format, size and source tag/attribute) and the option of choosing small/medium/view and scale-down/contains/cover for object-fit css property [`43de0af`](https://github.com/janreges/siteone-crawler/commit/43de0af1c60d398f91b373c192d1a35ac2df2fd1)
- core options: added a shortened version of the command name consisting of only one hyphen and the first letters of the words of the full command (e.g. --memory-limit has short version -ml), added getInitialScheme() [`eb9a3cc`](https://github.com/janreges/siteone-crawler/commit/eb9a3cc62dffc58be2701c52bb21509d39a5dfad)
- visited url: added 'sourceAttr' with information about where the given URL was found and useful helper methods [`6de4e39`](https://github.com/janreges/siteone-crawler/commit/6de4e39c5f8b9ba685e3865193274ccf0ee91a3d)
- found urls: in the case of the occurrence of one URL in several places/attributes, we consider the first one to be the main one (typically the same URL in src and then also in srcset) [`660bb2b`](https://github.com/janreges/siteone-crawler/commit/660bb2b2bd2cb6949fe9c573e72b31e9fb97a9fe)
- url parsing: added more recognition of which attributes the given URL address was parsed from (we need to recognize src and srcset for ImageGallery in particular) [`802c3c6`](https://github.com/janreges/siteone-crawler/commit/802c3c66a40087745e68f47392f0e6e8e9725171)
- supertable and urls: in removing the redundant hostname for a more compact URL output, we also take into account the scheme http:// or https:// of initial URL (otherwise somewhere it lookedlike duplicate) + prevention of ansi-color definitions for bash in the HTML output [`915469e`](https://github.com/janreges/siteone-crawler/commit/915469e2a4a6d0fed337ca70efe9170758751ade)
- title/description/keywords parsing: added html entities decoding because some website uses decoded entities with &#xED; &#x2013; etc [`920523d`](https://github.com/janreges/siteone-crawler/commit/920523d3c55baf6cd7b2602334d9776b3e40f4d7)
- crawler: added 'sourceAttr' to the swoole table queue and already visited URLs (we will use it in the Image Gallery for filtering, so as not to display unnecessarily and a lot of duplicate images only in other resolutions from the srcsets) [`0345abc`](https://github.com/janreges/siteone-crawler/commit/0345abc6dab770e3196dd88ff0123a2050828644)
- url parameter: it is already possible not to enter the scheme and https:// or http:// will be added automatically (http:// for e.g. for localhost) [`85e14e9`](https://github.com/janreges/siteone-crawler/commit/85e14e961b53b83c208ac936972a335cace61bf8)
- disabled images: in the case of a request to remove the images, replace their body with a 1x1px transparent gif and place a semi-transparent hatch with the crawler logo and opacity as a background [`c1418c3`](https://github.com/janreges/siteone-crawler/commit/c1418c3154301fd3995dde421b066f16850203e7)
- url regex filtering: added option , which will allow you to limit the list of crawled pages according to the declared regexps, but at the same time it will allow you to crawl and download assets (js, css, images, fonts, documents, etc.) from any URL (but with respect to allowed domains) [`21e67e5`](https://github.com/janreges/siteone-crawler/commit/21e67e5be74050cd5b7c9998654ed66f18db4d85)
- img srcset parsing: because a valid URL can also contain a comma (and various dynamic parametric img generators use them) and in the srcset a comma+whitespace should be used to separate multiple values, this is also reflected in the srcset parsing [`0db578b`](https://github.com/janreges/siteone-crawler/commit/0db578bda37c024b2b111c814e35c2107e4751ad)
- websocket server: added option to set --websocket-server, which starts a parallel process with the websocket server, through which the crawler sends various information about the progress of crawling (this will also be used by Electron UI applications) [`649132f`](https://github.com/janreges/siteone-crawler/commit/649132f8965421cd1bb3570fbb9f534e6caef313)
- http client: handle scenario when content loaded from cache is not valid (is_bool) [`1ddd099`](https://github.com/janreges/siteone-crawler/commit/1ddd099ecdadc5752016237ec1f0acf80e907dc8)
- HTML report: updated logo with final look [`2a3bb42`](https://github.com/janreges/siteone-crawler/commit/2a3bb428180067a649f2467419920b3d4f70a9fd)

- robots.txt: added info about loaded robots.txt to summary (limited to 10 domains for case of huge multi domain crawling) [`00f9365`](https://github.com/janreges/siteone-crawler/commit/00f93659637705bc6389c5f073a29f09b743370f)
- redirects analyzer: handled edge case with empty url [`e9be1e3`](https://github.com/janreges/siteone-crawler/commit/e9be1e350b1d114c54b7099b54277da23467b538)
- text output: added fancy banner with crawler logo (thanks to great SiteOne designers!) and smooth effect [`e011c35`](https://github.com/janreges/siteone-crawler/commit/e011c35f3cbc87fceb9d7a9c56c726817c79b543)

- crawler: added declare(strict_types=1) and banner [`27134d2`](https://github.com/janreges/siteone-crawler/commit/27134d29d16e3e24c633f010f731f11deeeadcb7)
- heading structure analysis: highlighting and calculating errors for duplicate &lt;h1&gt; + added help cursor with a hint [`f5c7db6`](https://github.com/janreges/siteone-crawler/commit/f5c7db6206ed06e0cbaf38a7ae2505be573da2e6)
- core options: added --help and --version, colorized help [`6f1ada1`](https://github.com/janreges/siteone-crawler/commit/6f1ada112898580d2de028c02e32fdeb8ad2a845)
- ./crawler binary - send output of cd - to /dev/null and hide unwanted printed script path [`16fe79d`](https://github.com/janreges/siteone-crawler/commit/16fe79d08e24c4a6fbd87d16417413725aaa24e8)

- options: --workers default for Cygwin runtime is now 1 (instead of 3), because Cygwin runtime is highly unstable when workers &gt; 1 [`f484960`](https://github.com/janreges/siteone-crawler/commit/f4849606fb382e1b759f547c4f1bfe2e5d8b4d02)
